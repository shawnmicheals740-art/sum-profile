  <h2 class="welcome-title">Welcome</h2>

  <p class="welcome-lead">
    I’m <strong>Sumedh Dixit</strong>, a <strong>Business Analyst</strong> with a strong
    <strong>product mindset</strong>, working at the intersection of
    <strong>SaaS platforms</strong>, <strong>supply-chain technology</strong>, and
    <strong>complex system integrations</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="welcome-text">
    I specialize in translating ambiguous business problems into clear requirements,
    stable releases, and scalable product solutions. Over the last few years, I’ve
    worked closely with product managers, engineers, QA teams, and enterprise customers
    to improve visibility, reliability, and decision-making across logistics and
    transportation systems.
  </p>

  <p class="welcome-text">
    My experience spans <strong>global supply-chain visibility platforms</strong>,
    <strong>Track &amp; Trace systems</strong>, <strong>TMS / OMS integrations</strong>,
    and <strong>EDI-driven workflows</strong>, where precision, data quality, and
    execution speed matter. I’m comfortable moving between strategy and execution —
    from defining user flows and acceptance criteria to supporting UAT, production
    releases, and post-launch improvements.
  </p>

  <p class="welcome-text">
    Think of this portfolio as a journey through the stations of my career — each section
    representing how I’ve grown from solving operational problems to contributing toward
    <strong>product stability</strong>, <strong>customer impact</strong>, and
    <strong>long-term platform scalability</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="welcome-highlight">
    I’m currently looking to grow into <strong>Product Management</strong> or
    <strong>Senior Business Analyst</strong> roles, where I can own problem spaces,
    collaborate deeply with cross-functional teams, and help build products that users
    trust every day.
